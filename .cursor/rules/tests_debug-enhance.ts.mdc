## Overview

The `tests/debug-enhance.ts` file is a test script designed to demonstrate and validate the process of enhancing a resume by analyzing a codebase and utilizing AI services. It integrates with GitHub and OpenAI services to fetch data and perform operations that enhance a sample resume with insights derived from the current project.

## Key Components

- **Environment Variables**: The script requires three environment variables: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `GITHUB_USERNAME`. These are essential for authenticating and interacting with the GitHub and OpenAI services.

- **Main Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the entire process:
  - **Validation**: Checks for the presence of necessary environment variables.
  - **Service Initialization**: Instantiates `GitHubService`, `OpenAIService`, `CodebaseAnalyzer`, and `ResumeEnhancer`.
  - **Sample Resume Creation**: Constructs a basic resume object to be enhanced.
  - **Codebase Analysis**: Utilizes `CodebaseAnalyzer` to gather insights about the current project.
  - **Resume Enhancement**: Calls `enhanceWithCurrentProject` on `ResumeEnhancer` to update the resume with new skills and project details based on the analysis.
  - **Error Handling**: Catches and logs any errors that occur during the process.

## Dependencies

This file imports several modules from the `src` directory:
- `GitHubService` for interacting with GitHub repositories.
- `OpenAIService` for leveraging AI capabilities.
- `CodebaseAnalyzer` for analyzing the codebase structure and content.
- `ResumeEnhancer` for applying enhancements to a resume.
- `Resume` type for defining the structure of a resume object.

## Usage

To run this script, ensure that the required environment variables are set. Execute the script in a Node.js environment to see the enhancement process in action. This script is primarily used for testing and debugging the resume enhancement functionality.

## Best Practices

- **Environment Configuration**: Always ensure that the necessary environment variables are correctly set before running the script.
- **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages for troubleshooting issues related to service initialization or API interactions.
- **Codebase Context**: Use this script in the context of a well-defined codebase to get meaningful enhancements.
- **Security**: Keep your API keys and tokens secure and do not hardcode them into the script.

This file serves as a practical example of integrating multiple services to enhance a resume, providing a useful template for similar tasks in other projects.
